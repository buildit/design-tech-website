# Design / Deliver What Matters
How modern engineering culture can strengthen our practice as designers. (Or how to get over ourselves and play nice with Wipro).

## Why are we running this course?
At Designit we want to design what matters. We want to solve complex challenges and create a positive impact in the world. In order to do this, we need to get our work into people’s lives – we need to deliver what we design. 

Wipro Digital are our teammate in this, designing and delivering impact together, but we’re often too far removed from them. We don’t collaborate with Tech specialists from the get go. We don’t work with a true understanding of modern delivery methods. We often do heavy up-front work and hand over outputs that we don’t see implemented, or with the impact that we’re looking for.

We have a responsibility to change this. We need to work with greater agility and collaboration, to continuously design (and deliver) what matters.

## What are we covering?
The purpose of this two-day course is to build a shared understanding across Designit of modern engineering culture, so that we can better communicate and collaborate with Wipro Digital, and strengthen our practice as designers.

You will walk away with a greater proficiency for balancing strategic design and delivery in projects; experience working in cross-functional teams with Tech specialists; and build a skillset around the principles of continuous improvement and delivery.

We are going to hold the mirror up to ourselves and challenge our perception about how we should approach projects in today’s world. The reality is that we need to design and deliver at an increasingly faster rate. We need to take a more iterative approach, collaborating in larger cross-functional teams and working with greater agility.

Are our current ways of working aligned with this reality? Do we spend too much time on up-front work, building strategies and blueprints and planning experiences? Do we truly work in cross-functional teams and collaborate as effectively as we could?

## What will you walk away with?
Over this two-day course you will work in teams with fellow Designits from around the world, plus some of the best Tech specialists from Wipro Digital: 


- Gain a greater proficiency at approaching strategic design and delivery projects with modern practices and mindsets:
    - Understand the evolution of modern engineering culture, what this means for us as designers, and how we should approach our work in partnership with Wipro Digital.
    - Build up an understanding of true agile values and principles, experience principles first-hand, and learn how to apply them in your work.
    - Shift the conversation away from outputs towards outcomes, to shape projects with Wipro Digital around the impact we want to deliver.


- Experience working in cross-functional teams with Tech specialists:
    - Understand the different roles that you’re likely to collaborate with, why they are important, and gain an appreciation of their skillsets.
    - Learn how to bring Tech specialists into cross-functional teams and the power of combining different mindsets and approaches.
    - Experience the benefits (and challenges) of balancing diversity, harmonising the voices in cross-functional teams, and how to turn our differences into an advantage.


- Build a skillset around the principles of continuous improvement and delivery:
    - Become masters of prioritisation and slicing up complex problems, to deliver value through small steps, scientific thinking, and experimentation.
    - Gain hands-on experience of lean concepts that reduce heavy up-front thinking and wasted effort, to increase the flow of designing and delivering of value.
    - Learn to embrace uncertainty, failure and learning, and simple routines for introducing the practice of continuous improvement in your work (and life).


## Where and when will this take place?
- Designit London
- 2-day course: Wednesday 20 and Thursday 21 November, 9am–4pm both days.
- As there will be lots of people flying in from around the world, we would love to spend more time getting to know each other outside of the course. Please join our welcome social on Tuesday 19 November, plus extra socials at the end of each day of training.

## Who can join in?
- Designit’s from around the World.
- Up to 20 Designit participants, with approximately 1 participant per office
- Most relevant for Senior and Lead Service Designers, UX Designers, and UI Designers – who are (or will be) at the front line of projects with Wipro Digital.
